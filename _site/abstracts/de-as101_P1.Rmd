**Preemptive Policies Vs Fundamental Rights: Implementing the Proportionality Approach**

*Abstract*: Preemptive policies diminish the targeted individual's range of future options
with the aim to prevent an individual antisocial behaviour that has been observed
in the past and may occur in the future. Examples include no-fly lists to prevent
terrorist attacks, predictive policing to prevent crimes and policies aiming at pre-
venting tax evasion. These policies may conflict with fundamental rights because
of both the data they use and the way these data are used. Preemptive policies
are based on a scrutiny of past individual behaviour, virtually including the whole
set of observable individual consumption and leisure choices, which poses a threat
to privacy rights, especially because the set of available information is continuously
growing due to expansion of Internet and other big data sources. Also, preemptive
policies use machine learning methods that can be black boxes which are impossible
to interpret for the individual so that the presumption of innocence and some funda-
mental rights of the defence are seriously undermined. According to the European
and Commonwealth legal tradition, the conflict between public interests and funda-
mental individual rights should be solved using the proportionality principle, whose
application, in turn, requires a cost and benet analysis of the policy at stake. In this paper we do two things. 
First, we build a reference cost-benet model and we
illustrate how it should be used by a lawmaker or a judge implement the proportion-
ality principle in the conflict between the purposes of the policy and privacy rights.
Second, we show how this approach can be applied using decision trees or random
forests model that also allow some interpretation of the selection rule and therefore
safeguard, at least to some extent, the individual's right of defence.
